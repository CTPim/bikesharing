## Summary

From the data that was gathered, it can be inferred that a majority of Citibike users are males who have a subscription to the service. Citibikes are heavily used during the hours of 7AM-9AM and 4PM-8PM, most likely coinciding with rush hours to and from work, school, or other daily activities. It can also be said that for a vast majority of users, the Citibikes are not used for more than 1 hour. 

Two additional visualizations I would recommend would be:
- differences in average trip time between genders
-average distance covered on a Citibike (using starting and ending points)
